vector machines
	- data level parallelism
		- operations on one piece of data are completely independent from others
		- loop level is one type
		- saves reloading instructions, renaming registers, etc.
	- helps with very long latency memory
	- almost always floating point
	- have special register file and L/S unit
	- functional units almost always pipelined
