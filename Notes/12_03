DVFS
	- P = C * V^2 * A * f
	- DVFS concerned with scaling V and f
	- Razor: scale down until you fail
	- changing V, f at runtime has time and energy costs
stacking effect
	- Putting two transistors in series dramatically reduces leakage
	- lots of research around using it in caches
		- determine size of working set, turn off parts you don't need
Let cache lines decay based off which are "dead"
