getting around hazards
	1) stall (stick a noop for the bubbles)
		- pipeline interlock (O(p), p = #pipeline stages)
	2) punt to the compiler
		- not general use; requires knowledge of pipeline
		- used sometimes in embedded system
	3) do something clever
		- structural hazards: add more hardware
		- forwarding/bypassing
			- doesn't always work! if latency is more than 1 cycle (load/use penalty)
