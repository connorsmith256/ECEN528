SISD
	- traditional instructions
SIMD
	- vectorized type instructions
	- less general than vector machines
MISD
	- systolic arrays, wavefront processors
MIMD
	- typical parallelism

SIMD
	- short, fixed-length vectors
	- instead of one 64-bit operation
		- 2 32-bit
		- 4 16-bit
		- 8 8-bit
	- really cheap to add: 2-3% area
	- very easy to accelerate media operations
	- eventually shifted to dedicated 128/256-bit
		- explosion in number of specialized instructions
	- poor backwards compatibility
		- compiler will not generate instructions even if it could with default flags
	- lack of support
		- no gather/scatter
		- no strides
		- no masks

Roofline models
	- programs won't achieve roofline
	- model allows for prediction of max performance on given machine
	- intensity = FLOPs / byte
		- lowest realistic: 2 loads + a store @ 8 bytes each = 1/24
	- top of roof is max FLOPs of machine
	- slope of roof is at 45 degrees such that intensity of 1 corresponds to 2nd bandwidth
	- ridge shows intersection of memory and compute limitation
