Kilo-Instruction Processors
	- last-ditch attempt at big ILP
	- no one has actually built these

Critical problems: structural hazards
	- reorder buffer:
		- allocate at dispatch, free at commit
		- space taken up by "dead" instructions waiting to commit
		- large latency requires huge buffers
		- branch misprediction is always a problem for integer benchmarks
	- instruction queues:
		- insert at dispatch, remove at issue
		- most "blocked-long" on long-latency instructions (eg. load miss in L2)
	- physical register files:
		- allocate at dispatch, free at commit of next instruction which renamed
		- a lot of dead instructions waiting to commit
			- waiting on possible misprediction
			- commits must be in order
	- load/store queues:
		- allocate at dispatch, free at commit

Things not considered
	- branch prediction accuracy varying
	- high-speed fetch(?)

Clever things
	- reorder buffer:
		- traditional ROB replaced by checkpoints and pseudo-ROB
	- instruction window:
		- split into slow-lane after falling out of pseudo-ROB
	- physical registers:
		- weird counting stuff
	- load/store queues:
		- hierarchical, prediction, buffers, hashing, completely remove it

Results
	IPC: 1.8-2.5
