Weak behaviours and programming assumptions

- concurrency poorly specified
	- documentation and programming guides contain ambiguity and omissions
	- vendors use proprietary systems, do not give semantics for instructions or provide assemblers
- goals
	- discover "weak behaviors" unknown to programmers
	- expose false programming assumptions made by community
- focus/assumptions
	- focus on interactions in the same CTA but different warps, or same grid but different CTA
	- assumes threads in same warp actually execute the same instructions
- weak behaviors
	- sequential consistency (SC) per location
		- coRR: coherence of read-read pairs
	- cache operators
		- coherent reads (coRR)
		- message massing (mp)
		- volatile access
- programming assumptions
	- "GPUs exhibit no weak memory behaviours"
