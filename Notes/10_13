history register
	- keep results of previous branchs
	- usually implemented in shift register
	- value from register combined with address in "mysterious" way
	- result used as index into pattern history table
	- most common mysterious way: gselect
		- use address as row, history as column to index into table
- branch history shift register table (BHSRT)
	- use address as index to get out history register, then concat as before

prediction = f(PHT[e(address, BHSRT[H(address)])])

f:
e: gselect, gshare, etc.

XAx
	- first X: BHSRT
	- A: adaptive
	- second x: PHT

	- G/g: global
	- P/p: per-address
	- S/s: set-aliased
