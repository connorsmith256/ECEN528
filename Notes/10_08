branch penalty
	- depends on where data is coming from
way of punting to the compiler to avoid stalls on branches
	- do other work in between (only works for conditional branches)
	- insert no-ops
	- 1) predication to remove branches
	- 2) branch delays slots
	- 3) clever stuff
		- guess (branch prediction), fix if wrong

branch prediction
	- simplest: assume always taken (only works with conditional branches)
		- not a big win with a penalty of 1, since there's still the penalty of 1
