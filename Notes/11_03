HW vs SW
	- HW has the advantage of being able to consider machine state
	- SW can see a larger scope

Perfect processor
	- perfect BP
		- even know future values!
	- perfect caches
	- infinite register renaming
		- no WAW/WAR hazards
	- infinite window size

Benchmarks
	- perfect processor: never more than 150 IPC
	- pessimistic processor: maybe 1.5 IPC

Caveats: H&P study assumptions
	- given output from compiler, try different architecture
		- compiler restructuring can *create* better ILP and shorten the dependence tree
	- no value prediction
		- never actually delivered; too hard
	- no memory renaming
