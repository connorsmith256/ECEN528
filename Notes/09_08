Simulation vs hardware:
	- cost
		- simulation is cheap!
		- hardware is ungodly expensive
	- accuracy
		- Are inputs realistic?
		- Are effects of OS included?
	- execution speed: simulation is slooooooowwww
	- development time
		- neither are quick
Simulation trade-offs (pick one):
	- speed
	- accuracy
		- level of abstraction
		- correctness
	- development time
