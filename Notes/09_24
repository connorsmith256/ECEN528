AMAT = hit time + miss rate * miss penalty
reducing miss penalty
	- multi level caches
	- reorder: do reads before writes
	- critical word first/early restart
	- non-blocking caches
		- overlap accesses
		- "memory-level parallelism"
	- merging write buffers
reducing miss rate
	- increasing block size
		- exploit spatial locality
	- higher associativity
		- reduces conflict misses
	- make it bigger
		- reduces capacity misses
