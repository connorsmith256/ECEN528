Things to worry about if you're designing a new computer
	- power
	- performance
	- size/space
	- cost
	- architecture (ISA)
	- peripherals (buses)
	- target applications/audience
	- memory speed
	- in-house development vs. outsourcing
	- process/technology
	- development tools
	- distinguishing features
	- user-friendliness
	- security
	- timeline
	- regulatory environment
	- standards
	- aesthetics
	- heat
	- reliability
	- ESD
	- testability
Computer Architecture
	- ISA: what is visible to a programmer
	- micro-architecture: how is the computer organized?
	- hardware components: the real world gets in the way
Key constraints
	- power
	- speed
	- not size and price: "silicon is essentially free"
Three components of focus
	1. parallelism
	2. locality: temporal and spatial, value, etc.
	3. focus on the common case
Trends
	- Moore's law: the number of transistors (at minimum cost/transistor) doubles every 18-24 months
